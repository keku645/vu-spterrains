-- If you're trying to create your own multiplayer preset, you're in the right place to learn how.
-- I've put comments below to try and show you how to create your own preset, so you can make a Rush map out of the Comrades map, or a 1v1 TDM map out of The Eleventh Hour.

-- First, you need to load in the right multiplayer data - that's what this Lua file does.
-- The fundamental method for making a multiplayer preset is that you need two parts: the SP or COOP level you want to make the preset for, and the MP level you're using to copy logic from.

-- By the way, as a rule of thumb, if there's no comment by a bit of code saying to change it, DON'T CHANGE IT!

-- You can use the ThunderRun_CQL preset (adding Conquest Large to Thunder Run SP_Tank) for another set of examples, although unannotated.

-- For any questions, SassythSasqutch#9081 on Discord is more than willing to help.
